# FriendFinder

"You got a friend in me" - Toy Story

Everyone wants to have a friend, but the problem is it if often hard to find someone who we have the same in common with. (Lack of time, don't wanna talk to people).

To solve this, I made a very simple friend finder.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Each question has a scale from 1-5; 5 being strongly agree and 1 being strongly disagree. Select the answer that best describes you for each question and submit your answers. 

My fancy code will check the database for your best match. BOOM new friend! (Almost, you still need to reach out ;)
